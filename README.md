<h3 style="color: #59C002;"> Local, Emerging and triple j Unearthed artists announced. </h3>
<p> Groovin the Moo offers a huge round of applause to the new breed of artists who are joining the 2016 GTM events in each region. We invite patrons to come along early and celebrate the diversity of incredible new talent as the emerging and local artists introduce themselves to you – their comMOOunity! </p>
<strong> MAITLAND – Saturday April 23 (ANZAC Day long weekend) </strong>
<p> Opening the first GTM leg in Maitland will be triple j Unearthed winners Eat Your Heart Out, a five-piece from Newcastle who pulled together some impressive alt/pop punk tunes on last year's debut EP, Distance Between Us. </p>
<p> We look forward to Maitland witnessing L-Fresh The Lion’s powerful presence and thought-provoking lyrics. The Lulu Raes with their sun-soaked dance pop, Wafia delivering with her beautiful vocals and our Moo Crew dancing amongst World Champion’s Avocado Galaxy. </p>
<p> The Plot stage will return for a second year running featuring a mix of electronic, dancehall, hip hop, tech house, baile funk, cumbia and a hint of trap from a seriously exciting selection of producers and DJs - Bad Decisions, Human Movement, Jaytee Hazard, Kinder, LUEN and Argentine duo, Frikstailers. </p>
 
<strong> CANBERRA – Sunday April 24 (ANZAC Day long weekend) </strong>
<p> Canberra, you’re in for a treat with these rising stars rounding out the touring line up… </p>
<p> Genesis Owusu is a young and up-and-coming wordsmith notably recognised as a vibrant half of duo, The Ansah Brothers, with brother, Citizen Kay. Folktronica darling Gordi with her luminous indie-pop and Hockey Dad, who have taken time out from the beach to bring their 60’s surf-rock inspired pop tunes. </p>
<p> Inventive MC LTC (which stands for Lolesio The Courageous) was featured in the Unearthed Forecast as one to watch for 2016. Chosen as the Canberra triple j Unearthed winner you'll get to watch him do his thing in his hometown at the Canberra GTM. </p>
<p> If you haven’t seen Polish Club live, you need to - in any one of their numbers, the full-bodied howl of Motown’s finest front men is passed through the garage rock scuzz of Detroit. </p>
<p> For the first time, The Plot will be popping up at Canberra GTM to provide another space for even more dance. Expect to get sweaty with a mix of beats, house grooves, disco, juke, hip hop, electronic, baile funk and cumbia – proudly brought to you by an all-star cast of Fishing, Klue, Moonbase Commander, 
Set Mo, Tom Tilley and Argentine duo, Frikstailers. </p>
 
<strong> OAKBANK – Monday April 25 (ANZAC Day public holiday) </strong>
<p>Oakbank GTM is exceptionally proud to play host to: </p>
<p>The duo A.B Originals (Briggs and Trials) dedicated to making a difference through their musical collaboration.  Grenadiers and their killer stage show filled with energetic rock. We’re looking forward to experiencing L.K McKay and his bouncy technicolour beats. West Thebarton Brothel Party, recently crowned as triple j Unearthed winners will bring their vibrantly hot mess of thrashy guitars and garage rock chaos.  </p>
<p>Curated by Laneway IV – Container Bar, Hilltown is a brand new space where our Moo Crew can get their dance on! </p>
 
<strong> BENDIGO – Saturday April 30 – SOLD OUT </strong>
<p>We know our Bendigo Moo Crew will make everyone feel welcome, especially the latest additions to our sold out Saturday 30 April event: </p>
<p>Dylan Joel, equal parts poet, producer and lyricist. Ivan Ooze, possibly the only rapper who has borrowed his alias from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Jack And The Kids (triple j Unearthed), an ensemble who know how to put a widescreen lens over their big indie rock anthems. Olympia, a songstress with an ethereal voice and lyrics that paint pictures in your mind. Tiny Little Houses, purveyors of fuzzy folk rock creations. </p>
<p>The Plot stage will return for a second year dropping a mix of loud, banging bass, R&amp;B, house, electronica, baile funk and cumbia dealt out by an insanely fun line-up featuring Benson, Dugong Jr &amp; Fossa Beats, Hey Sam, Mike Metro, Running Touch and Argentine duo, Frikstailers. </p>
 
<strong> TOWNSVILLE – Sunday May 1 (long weekend Labour Day public holiday) </strong>
<p>With the return of the Labour Day long weekend (May Day), GTM Townsville is the perfect road trip destination! Get a Moo crew together and head into GTM early. Our line up of emerging and local talent for Townsville has something for everyone.   </p>
<p>Morning Harvey are building a solid reputation as ‘ones to watch’ with their psychedelic drenched pop. Local singer songwriter, Nicole Cross crafts quirky folk tunes that take you though a maze of melodic twists and turns. Oh Forest Shore (triple j Unearthed) craft some chilled out electronica that'll give you the nice vibes under the Townsville sun. Giving props to Dune Rats, Violent Soho and Fidlar as key influences, Pandamic are bringing their anthemic rock / punk / scumbag bangers. </p>
<p> Curated by local collective Very Casual (the team behind Flinders Social), Stranded is a brand new space where our Moo Crew can hit the dancefloor. With the soundtrack supplied by the best of the best in the local dance scene, there’s no excuse not to party with GTM on the long weekend. </p>
 
<strong> BUNBURY – Saturday May 7th </strong>
<p> The finale of the GTM Tour is a pretty special occasion and Bunbury’s supportive community beams enthusiasm as the GTM tour comes to an end. We’re pumped the following artists are joining us for the day: </p>
 
<p> Grrl Pal is a girl-boy electro-pop duo that writes, records and produces dream-filled synth pop. Longshore (triple j Unearthed) will crank the amps and pump out the heavy riffs - Devil's horns at the ready, fans. Previous winners of Unearthed High, Mosquito Coast will be punching out their sun-bleached, guitar-driven pop. Time Pilot inhabit a world of retro motif and harmonic melody that sounds equal parts ‘sweating in the club’ and ‘sunday’s on the couch (in 2050)’. Verge Collection expertly balance classic pop sensibilities and working class poetry to channel the collective conscious of suburban Australia millennials. </p>
 
<p> Mootown is returning in 2016 in fine form! Western Australia is proving why west is best with a line-up featuring an impressive A-list of producers and DJs from Perth, Bunbury and surrounding areas. Elk Road, HWLS, Loston, Boston Switch, Canzirri vs Bobby Chance, Dusk2Dawn vs Forzland, Floor Play, Jaspa, Juddy Aus, Lifekoach, Liquid Culture DJs, will ensure our Moo crew are on the dancefloor from start to finish as Mootown traverses Electro, Drum &amp; Bass, Breakbeat, Tropical House, trap, RnB and bounce. </p>
 
<p> In national news: </p>
<p> Groovin the Moo welcomes dance maker, word shaper and radio host, Amrita Hepi with her ‘Pop Culture Dance Class’ to the national tour. Amrita is also a descendant of the Bundjulung (NSW) and Ngapuhi (NZ) people and she will be guiding our Moo Crew through a uniquely “unbielebable” experience. This is a beginners class and a no-shame zone (it’s also dark, sweaty, loud and most importantly fun) all shapes and levels welcome. </p>
<p> Tickets to GTM BENDIGO have long sold out. MAITLAND and CANBERRA events are following suit soon and before you know it with the blink of an eye the GTM bus will be rolling into your region. Be sure to get ahead of the pack and MOOve it to secure your spot at Australia’s only regional touring festival. </p>
